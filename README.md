# ❗ About
My personal YOUGOTMEMED Trojan based of VineMEMZ by Leurak

Coded with C, Python, .Bat, Powershell

this is a continual project so expect intermittent updates

# ❗ Why

The real question is why did you even ask? :)

# ❗ What I learned (or am learning)

I kinda learned a little about compilers. BAT files, and the structure of C++ in terms of Windows deployments. It's neat.

# ❗ WHAT IT HAS

Tunneling, taskbar service inactivations, errors, random file deletions. I even added dummy files for your perusal.

HOW DO I LOCATE THEM?!

...There will be a file named, "dummy files" or something. Download, locate within, and read the README.
‼️‼️ I believe it's fully deployable if you click the BAT file. BE CAREFUL!
